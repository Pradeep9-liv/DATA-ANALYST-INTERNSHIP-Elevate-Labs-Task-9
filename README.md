# DATA-ANALYST-INTERNSHIP-Elevate-Labs-Task-9


---

## Implementation Steps

1. Identified fact and dimension tables from transactional data  
2. Created dimension tables with **surrogate primary keys**  
3. Created a fact table with **foreign key relationships**  
4. Inserted distinct dimension records from the source dataset  
5. Loaded transactional data into the fact table using key mappings  
6. Added indexes on foreign keys to optimize joins  
7. Executed analytical queries using star-schema joins  
8. Validated row counts and foreign key integrity  
9. Generated a star schema diagram for documentation

## Sample Analytics Queries

- Total sales by product category  
- Regional sales performance  
- Year-wise sales trends  
- Profit analysis across segments  

These queries leverage star schema joins for fast aggregation and reporting.

---

## Data Validation

- Verified fact table record count matches source dataset  
- Confirmed no missing foreign key mappings  
- Ensured referential integrity across all dimensions  

---

## Tools & Technologies

- SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL compatible)
- Relational Database Concepts
- Data Warehousing (Star Schema Modeling)
- ER Diagram Design

---

## Key Learning Outcomes

- Practical star schema modeling
- Dimensional design using surrogate keys
- Fact-to-dimension relationship mapping
- Query optimization using indexes
- Business analytics using warehouse data

---

## Use Cases

- Business Intelligence dashboards (Power BI / Tableau)
- Sales and profit analysis
- Data engineering portfolio project
- Interview demonstration of data modeling skills
